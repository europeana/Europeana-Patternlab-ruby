# Europeana::Styleguide

Europeana::Styleguide contains [Mustache](https://github.com/mustache/mustache)
templates for a consistent front-end design across Europeana's Ruby on Rails web
applications.

Templates in this repository are automatically updated from commits to
[Europeana-Patternlab's](https://github.com/europeana/Europeana-Patternlab)
`source/_patterns` directory.

## Installation

Add these lines to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'europeana-styleguide', github: 'europeana/europeana-styleguide-ruby'
gem 'europeana-i18n', github: 'europeana/europeana-i18n-ruby'
gem 'stache', github: 'europeana/stache', branch: 'europeana-styleguide' # until upstream merges our pull requests
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Configuration

### Asset host

You will need to set the environment variable `EUROPEANA_STYLEGUIDE_ASSET_HOST`
to the base URL where the styleguide assets are to be served from.

### Caching

In a production environment, it is strongly recommended that you enable the
caching of compiled templates.

Without this, the Mustache templates are compiled into ERB every time that they
are needed, which is a resource intensive process.

To enable template caching, create an initializer in your Rails app:

```ruby
# config/initializers/stache.rb
Stache.configure do |c|
  # Store compiled templates in memory
  c.template_cache = ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore.new
end
```

## Usage

### Controllers

The gem's Mustache templates are in its
[app/views directory](app/views/). To make these available as views in your
application, include the module `Europeana::Styleguide` in the relevant
controller:

```ruby
class StyledController < ApplicationController
  include Europeana::Styleguide
end
```

Include the module in `ApplicationController` to make the styleguide templates
available to all controllers.

### View templates

Styleguide templates do not following Rails's view naming conventions. You
will need to:

1. Create a view template in your app/views directory named after the controller
  action, as usual
2. In that view template, include the page-specific styleguide template, along
  with the styleguide header and footer

See "complete example", below, for a demonstration.

#### Customising templates

Individual Mustache templates can be overriden locally by creating a file of the
same name in your application's app/views directory. For example, to
override the gem's `app/views/templates/Search/Search-results-list.mustache`
template, copy it to `$RAILS_ROOT/app/views/templates/Search/Search-results-list.mustache`
and edit as required.

#### Updating templates

If you also have the [Europeana-Patternlab](https://github.com/europeana/Europeana-Patternlab)
repository cloned and want to use it to populate view templates and other assets
in your clone of europeana-styleguide-ruby, for instance to test a feature branch
of the PatternLab repository, use the supplied Rake task:
```
bundle exec rake europeana_styleguide:populate[../Europeana-Patternlab]
```
... assuming that the cloned PatternLab repository is in the directory 
`../Europeana-Patternab`.

### View classes

Data is supplied to the Mustache templates for variable placeholder expansion via
[Stache](https://github.com/agoragames/stache) view classes named after the
controller action, and stored under app/views alongside the Mustache templates.
These view classes should sub-class `Europeana::Styleguide::View`.

For example, given a controller action `SearchController#index`, with a view
template `app/views/search/index.html.mustache`, provide data to it via a view
class named `Search::Index`.

Any *public* methods of a view class will be available for the expansion of
variable placeholders in the Mustache template. All such methods must be
parameterless. For example:

*app/views/search/index.html.mustache:*
```mustache
<p>{{result_count}}</p>
```

*app/views/templates/search/search_results_list.rb:*
```ruby
module Search
  class Index < Europeana::Styleguide::View
    def result_count
      @response.total
    end
  end
end
```

View classes will have access to any instance variables set on your controller,
and any view helper methods.

To support nested variable placeholders separated by ".", have your methods
return a Ruby `Hash` with keys like the placeholder's sub-keys, or an object
responding to methods like the placeholder's sub-keys.

### Layouts

**Rails layouts will not work,** because expansion of variable placeholders
from the Mustache templates is not performed within the layout.

### I18n

Europeana::Styleguide contains a helper to allow you to perform Rails i18n
lookups from within Mustache templates. Prefix a variable placeholder in the
template with "i18n." and its expansion will be translated from the
application's available locales.

*app/views/welcome/index.html.mustache:*
```mustache
<p>{{i18n.welcome.index.hello}}</p>
```

*config/locales/en.yml:*
```yaml
en:
  welcome:
    index:
      hello: Hello World
```

## Complete example

### Controller

*app/controllers/search_controller.rb:*
```ruby
class SearchController < ApplicationController
  include Europeana::Styleguide

  def index
    # search logic
    @results = ['result 1', 'result 2']
  end
end
```

### View class
*app/views/search/index.rb:*
```ruby
module Search
  class Index < Europeana::Styleguide::View
    def page_title
      t('search.index.page_title')
    end

    def result_count
      @results.size
    end
  end
end
```

### View template
*app/views/search/index.html.mustache:*
```mustache
{{>atoms/meta/_head}}
{{>templates/Search/Search-results-list}}
{{>atoms/meta/_foot}}
```
